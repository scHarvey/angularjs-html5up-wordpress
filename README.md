angularjs-html5up-wordpress
===========================

THIS IS VERY OUTDATED AND THERE ARE MUCH BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS THESE DAYS. THIS ANGULAR CODE IS PARTICULARLY OLD.

Basic AngularJS powered site based on http://html5up.net templates and pulling data from WordPress with the json api plugin ( https://github.com/WP-API )

Working Examples: http://catchfiredev.com/angWP1/ and http://catchfiredev.com/angWP2/
